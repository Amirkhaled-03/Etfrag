## Overview

Etfrag is a feature-rich platform developed using .NET MVC that allows users to enjoy a seamless streaming experience. The platform is built with scalability and clean code in mind, leveraging a three-tier architecture and implementing best practices like the Unit of Work and Repository patterns.

## Features

### User Features

## Technologies Used
- **.NET MVC**: For building the web application.
- **Entity Framework (Code First)**: To handle database operations with a code-first approach.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and visually appealing UI.
- **SQL Server**: To store and manage data.

## Architecture
- **Three-Tier Architecture**: The application is structured into Presentation Layer (PL), Business Logic Layer (BLL), and Data Access Layer (DAL) to enhance maintainability and separation of concerns.
- **Unit of Work and Repository Patterns**: These patterns are used to provide a clean separation between the database and the business logic, making the code more modular and testable.
- **Code-First Approach**: The project uses Entity Framework's code-first approach, which enables creating the database directly from the C# code.

## Skills Gained
- **.NET MVC**: Developed an understanding of building MVC applications in .NET.
- **Entity Framework (Code First)**: Gained experience in database design and working with the Entity Framework.
- **Database Design**: Designed and managed the SQL Server database.
- **Application Architecture**: Implemented a clean, scalable architecture using a three-tier approach.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **SQL Server**: Experience in database management and querying.
